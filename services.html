    Easy to use
  </h1>
  <p class="services-p1">
    We understand that preparing for postsecondary studies, especially when moving in a completely new area, can be a difficult and stressful time. That's why we decided to make Internull user-friendly in order to improve your experience!

  <h1 class="services-h1-2">
    Free to use
  </h1>
  <p class="services-p2">
    Postsecondary tuition is expensive, and even more so for those looking to travel abroad. That is why we decided that our service should be free to use. If you're not satisfied with the free version of Internull, we always have an option to upgrade to premium.

  <h1 class="services-h1">
    Personalized choice of recommended properties
  </h1>
  <p class="services-p1">
    Once you sign up for an Internull account, you will be given an optional questionnaire. After a user has completed the questionnaire, our algorithms will filter out properties in order to recommend the user properties that would best suit them. We do this in order to make it easier for each user to find properties that fit their needs.
